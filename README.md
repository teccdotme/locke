# Locke Programming Language

The **Locke Programming Language** is a statically-typed, object-oriented and modern programming language inspired by many of the modern languages in use today (Kotlin, TypeScript, etc.) developed by, well, me (mostly).

> The amount of revisions to the grammar I made is uncanny. 

## Specification

Because Locke is intended to be easy to implement for anyone, it has a specification.

This specification can be found on [this page](http://locke.tecc.me/spec/); feedback is greatly appreciated! 

## Contributors

I'm currently looking for additional contributors for this project as developing it is a hassle.

Currently, the main needs are:

- Testers; I need bugs to fix so that I someday can roll out a "stable" release.

- Developers. I know I am a developer, but I need someone to do the standard library/CLI development.

- Writers; responsible for writing documentation, examples, guides, whatever., with a consistent style, because I have none.

If you want to help just shoot me a message on Discord: `tecc#0001`.
